Welcome!

I'm a Full Stack Developer at **Intercontinental Exchange**, where I dive deep into the world of trading and supporting applications. Think of me as the wizard behind the curtain, making magic happen with code. I wrapped up my Master of Computer Science at the **University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign** in December 2023, which means I survived both advanced algorithms and the Midwest winters.

Before my current adventure, I was an SDE Intern at **MathWorks**, where I got to flex my coding muscles. My previous quest was at **Deutsche Bank Group**, where I spent three years developing a web-based application to help the bank identify and assess risk. Imagine being the digital Sherlock Holmes of the financial world â€“ that was me.

Before that, I was a Project Intern at **Persistent Systems**, working on a blockchain-based application. Yes, I was into blockchain before it was cool. I have a knack for designing scalable systems and microservices using C++, Java SpringBoot, ReactJS, and Oracle SQL. My interests are as diverse as a software engineering Swiss Army knife: web apps, mobile apps, and decentralized applications.

I completed my undergraduate studies in Computer Science at the Pune Institute of Computer Technology (PICT) in 2019. I am fluent in **Java, JavaScript, Python, and C++** â€“ basically, if itâ€™s a programming language, I've probably dabbled in it. I'm always looking to level up my skills and have proven myself through various projects, experiences, and the occasional coding-induced existential crisis.
