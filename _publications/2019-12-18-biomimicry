Many of the advancements made in the field of computers and robotics have been made possible due to an inspiration from nature. Observing the way insects behave gave us swarm algorithms, observing structure of neurons gave us Artificial Neural Networks etc. Biomimicry has been practiced since ancient times, and we are still learning from nature, whether in the field of robotics and smart systems, or in algorithms and networks. However, many of these Biomimetic applications are not directly apparent. This paper aims to summarize various such biomimetic applications in technology, along with giving a condensed explanation of the same.
