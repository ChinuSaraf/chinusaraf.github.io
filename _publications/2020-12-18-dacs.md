excerpt: 'Currently, various organizations rely on third-party access control and resource management applications or develop their centralized application for resource management. Considering the pitfalls of present centralized applications, we proposed the decentralized application-based approach toward organizational resource management and access control provisioning within or across organizational units. The research paper attempts to provide solutions for problems and risks associated with centralized resource and access control management systems. The paper was presented at IEEE international conference and is published on the IEEE Xplore.'

Currently, various organizations rely on third-party access control and resource management applications or develop their centralized application for resource management. Considering the pitfalls of present centralized applications, the proposed solution presents a decentralized approach towards organizational resource management and access control provisioning within or across organizational units. The research attempts to provide solutions for problems and risks associated with a centralized resource and access control management systems. This approach leverages the advantages of the permissioned Blockchain framework - Hyperledger Fabric and peer-to-peer network. The proposed solution also provides Single Sign-On authentication mechanism (SSO) for various organizational resources. Using the approach presented in the paper we can develop an efficient way of Team management with which we can achieve a higher degree of autonomy of subdivisions within an organization.
